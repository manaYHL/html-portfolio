<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Statement</h2>
<p>
  I was born and raised in Northeast China, graduated from the University of
  International Business and Economics with an International Politics major.
  Like a lot of other Asian young people, I had never thought about what kind of
  career I wanted to have in the future, since the only goal for me back then
  was getting admitted to a top-tier university, thinking that I would naturally
  get a great job after the graduation. That's what I was told by my parents and
  school teachers.
</p>

<p>
  However, I struggled a lot with my study in the university because I didn't
  like my major at all. More importantly, I didn't even know where my passion
  lied and what I was good at. Then, I came to Korea, fumbled around in the dark
  for two years, did various types of part-time jobs. However, I was not
  satisfied with the financial and social status back then. So I decided to
  apply for a graduate program, exactly knowing what I didn't like but still not
  knowing what I felt passionate about. Since I was exposed to a lot of business
  and financial information during my university, I decided to challenge for the
  finance major. That's the only area that I was relatively familiar with other
  than the International Politics.
</p>

<p>
  Surprisingly, I got admitted to the program and did a quite decent job. During
  the time, I got to know about data science, and about programming. And I
  immediately got mesmerized by the power and the insight I could get out of the
  tools such as R, Python, and Java. After graduation, I was able to get an
  investment related job. By getting lots of second-hand information of how
  corporations running their businesses, I started to realize that if I want to
  thrive then I have to know better about computer and technology. That's why I
  decided to learn more deeply about programming and am very sure that I would
  do a good job. Now I am very certain about what I want to do and achieve,
  because I know that I would be good in the fintech domain given the
  background, talent, and determination that I have now.
