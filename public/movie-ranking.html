<h1>The Best Movies According to Mana</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>
  It's a story of an Asian immgration family in the U.S. It has a lot of twists
  and combines various genres like martial arts, scientific fictions, and family
  ethics. It has won the best picture in the Oscar Awards in 2023.
</p>

<h3>Portrait Of A Lady On Fire</h3>
<p>
  This French movie is about two women falling in love with each other in the
  19th centry. It's beautifully shot, and every scene in the movie is like a
  painting. It's one of the most beautiful romance movies in my opinion.
</p>

<h3>Harry Porter Series</h3>
<p>
  Harry Porter Series are my childhood memories. They have an irreplaceable
  position in my mind. I like them not just because the story is fantastic, it's
  also because the performances of every actor and actress in the movie are
  extraordinary.
